# SIGN_LANGUAGE_MODEL
I created a Sign Language Recognition Model using computer vision and machine learning to aid individuals with hearing or speech impairments. Trained with gesture datasets and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model accurately converts hand gestures into text or speech, fostering inclusivity in communication.
